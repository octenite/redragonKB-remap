Remap any key , including FN ,modifying and adding keys to  FN layer 

Read instructons to determine if your keyboard supports this method

Instuctions explain how to use the K-MAP and Hex Output files for
making your very own custom remap of keys by modifying the cfg.ini file
(cfg.ini is located in the installation directroy of your keyboard software)

The modifications are applied through the software provided 
by the manufacturer (check out 'how to' in instructions )

Personally tested on Redragon k617!
I have provided modified cfg file for K617 adding 
media keys and remappig FN
